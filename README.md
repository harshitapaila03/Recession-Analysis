# Recession-Analysis


## Introduction
A recession is an economic situation that occurs when the circulation of money in the economy is low for two consecutive quarters. When money circulation decreases, consumer spending reduces, leading to business losses, economic slowdown, and potential layoffsâ€”a scenario observed globally in 2023.

Recession is typically analyzed based on several factors including GDP growth, unemployment rates, and consumer spending patterns. However, the most common method is through the examination of monthly GDP growth data.

For this analysis, we utilize a dataset containing monthly GDP growth rates for the United Kingdom, enabling us to identify and understand recession patterns within the economy.

## Recession Analysis
Recession periods are identified by analyzing the monthly GDP growth data. The goal is to detect periods of consecutive negative growth, indicating economic downturns. This analysis is visualized through various charts and graphs to provide a clearer understanding of recession periods and their impact.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and transformation of UK monthly GDP data.
- Identification of recession periods based on consecutive negative GDP growth.
- Visualization of:
  - Monthly GDP growth with highlighted recession periods.
  - Quarterly GDP growth with recession annotations.
  - Recession severity analysis using scatter plots.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:
- `Time Period`: The month and year of the GDP data point.
- `GDP Growth`: The GDP growth rate for the given month.
